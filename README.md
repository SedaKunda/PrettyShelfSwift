# PrettyShelfSwift

A book cataloguing system

This project is a starting point for a simple book cataloguing application in Swift.

It queries the OpenLibrary API to allow the user to search for a book using its ISBN.

It was created to help me compare making apps in Swift, Dart and Kotlin.
- The [Dart/Flutter](https://github.com/SedaKunda/PrettyShelf) version.
- The [Kotlin](https://github.com/SedaKunda/PrettyShelfKotlin) version.
